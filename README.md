## Overview
 * Business Problem
      * For this project Data Explorers used data analysis and statistical methods to generate metrics where Computer Vision should invest their funds in
        to be able to create a new movie studio and have a positive flow in profits coming in. 
       
 * Business Solution
      * We recommend Computer Vision to produce movies of the Musical, Animation, Sci-Fi or Adventure genres. 
      * Target top 7 languages for max region reach.
      * Invest in popular directors.

## Business Understanding
  * Computing Vision (a made-up company for the purposes of this project) sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
